web-link: https://ecommerce-fraud-predictor.herokuapp.com/



This web app predicts on E-Commerce Data Transaction Frauds. It is based on Machine Learning and Neural Network models. 

**Seven Machine Learning Algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbours and KMeans Algorithm) and two Deep Learning Neural Network models (Single layer perceptron and Multi layered Perceptron) were trained and tested on the E-Transaction Dataset (kaggle) and the models with best accuracy percentile were employed to built the web-predictor.**

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

* streamlit
* pandas
* sklearn
* seaborn
* matplotlib.pyplot
* pickle
